# SOBYTE — The Modular AI-Powered Development Framework for Solana

SOBYTE is an intelligent modular development framework that enables builders to create Solana projects the way they assemble code blocks — faster, safer, and easier to maintain.

On Solana, the real bottleneck is not the lack of ideas.
It’s how fast those ideas can become reusable, maintainable, and scalable code.
SOBYTE does not aim to be another tool.
It shifts how on-chain engineering is done — connecting modules, best practices, AI generation, and deployment into one continuous system.

Inside SOBYTE, every project is decomposed into composable functional modules:
• Token issuance, staking, locking, and revenue sharing
• Access control, multisig, and role systems
• NFT / collections and metadata management
• Oracle integrations and prediction market logic
• Integrations with AMMs, liquidity tools, and more

You don’t need to implement everything from scratch.
With SOBYTE, you simply select modules, generate scaffolding, run checks, and deploy.
If you understand the business logic, you can ship on Solana.
If you’re already a developer, your productivity jumps to a new dimension.

------------------------------------------------------------

WORKFLOW

SOBYTE has a 2-phase development process:

1) Build
- Select Modules: tokens, NFTs, roles, governance, and more.
- Generate Scaffolding: SOBYTE automatically creates the full project structure and core contract layout.

2) Ship
- Run Checks: logic validation and basic security scanning.
- Deploy Fast: deploy instantly to Devnet, Testnet, or Mainnet.

------------------------------------------------------------

PROJECT MISSION

To make Solana development truly fast, safe, and accessible to everyone — from newcomers to advanced developers.

------------------------------------------------------------

SECURITY REMINDER

Only use the official website and the official GitHub repository.
Do not purchase fake tokens or interact with unofficial contracts.

------------------------------------------------------------

STATUS

SOBYTE V1 is live and open-sourced on GitHub.
The codebase contains more than 1700 commits and continues to update weekly.
