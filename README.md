## Overview

**DigimonGotchi** brings the evolution concept of classic Digimon on-chain.

The project consists of a single Digimon living on Solana.  
It owns its own wallet and trades in real crypto markets using creator fees as its only source of funding.

There is no user control and no predefined path.  
The Digimon’s evolution is determined entirely by its trading behavior — how it takes risk, how it holds positions, and how it survives market volatility.

---

## How It Works

- The Digimon has a dedicated on-chain wallet  
- All activity is funded exclusively by creator fees  
- Trades are real and executed on-chain  
- No external deposits or manual intervention  
- No optimization for performance or profit

Every action leaves a trace.  
Every decision affects its state.

---

## Evolution Logic

There are no levels, feeding mechanics, or upgrade systems.

Evolution is not a reward.  
It is the natural outcome of accumulated trading behavior.

Based on its actions, the Digimon may:
- Grow
- Regress
- Mutate
- Or die

There is no reset.

---

## What This Is Not

- Not a game  
- Not a trading bot  
- Not a financial product  
- No profit guarantees  
- No user ownership or control  

DigimonGotchi exists as an observation, not a promise.

---

## Transparency

- All trades are on-chain  
- All funding comes from creator fees  
- All outcomes are public and verifiable  

Nothing is hidden. Nothing is edited.

---

## Philosophy

We do not guide it.  
We do not correct it.  
We do not protect it.

**We simply place it in the market and observe.**
